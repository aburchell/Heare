## Hear what's Here

Created for a local, one-day hackathon, this prototype iOS app allows users to 
spatially-embed audio recordings. Inspired by the belief that sound is a moving
and fundamental aspect of many of our lived experiences, Heare makes just one step
toward more fully merging the beauty of our physical and digital lives.
